   <h1>The Flavor and Texture</h1>

   <p>Stop into any our ice cream parlor or peak inside the case at the supermarket,
    and you will witness the expansive array of flavors, from traditional vanilla and
    coffee ice creams to somewhat unusual flavors such as sweet basil and sweet
    potato. But when it comes to gelato, the flavor profile is much more narrow.
    There are a few classics you'll find in gelato form—vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut,
    and stracciatella (vanilla with crunchy chocolate pieces), as well as pistachio,
    tiramisu, and a variety of fruit flavors—but not necessarily the type of
    combinations you see in the ice cream aisle.</p>

    <p>The differences in both treats' compositions and the way they are stored affect
        the way they taste and feel in your mouth. Fat coats the tongue, creating a layer
        between the taste buds and the food you are eating, and colder food numbs the
        tongue a bit, making it more difficult to actually taste the food. Since gelato has
        less fat and is warmer than ice cream, the flavors come through more and are
        more intense. These factors also make for a smoother consistency whereas ice
        cream has more of a fine crystal texture.</p>
